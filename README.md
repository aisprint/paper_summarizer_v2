# Paper Summarizer

## Overview
This project includes a Python application that summarizes PDF documents using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic. This is my first Python project. I've created an app that summarizes scientific papers using LLMs (like GPT and Claude 3).

## Installation
Clone this repository and install required packages:

git clone https://github.com/aisprint/paper_summarizer.git
cd paper_summarizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you have any advice or suggestions, especially since I am new to GitHub, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Note
As this is my first experience with Python projects and using GitHub, I am still getting familiar with these platforms. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.
